A web application built with the Django Rest Framework, React, and Redux.


Users can find subway stations that are near them based on their geolocation and can also search for stations by name. They can then see which train lines run at each station, get live service information about each line, and view stations on a map.


The app queries the MTAâ€™s API to provide live service updates and uses data from NYC Open Data for information about each station.


Users can save train lines to their favorites to quickly view in one place whether or not any of their regular trains are having service issues.


This is an updated version of an old project that I did. See the original project here:
